hello! this is kapa-Nitori, also known as Rafelandroid2. this is my github repo for my gmtk game jam POSSIBLE submission.

the theme of the jam is Built to Scale, which in my interpretation would be something about size and/or size manipulation.

i think i have a pretty good idea in my head. so i'll try doing that!

the name Lucky Mallet is taken from Shinmyoumaru's Lucky Mallet from Touhou 14. so yes, i'm a touhou fan. Kappa-pa Kappa-pa Nitori!
